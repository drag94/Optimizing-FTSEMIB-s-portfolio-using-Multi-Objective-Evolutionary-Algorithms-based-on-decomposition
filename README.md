### Abstract

> Choosing the optimal weights to invest in individual stocks so as to obtain
a portfolio that maximises returns and minimises risk has always been
one of the main problems in mathematical finance. A class of optimisation algorithms called Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms
based on decomposition (MOEA/D) will be used in order to solve this
task. In this project, these algorithms that are currently considered
to be at the state-of-the-art will be used and compared. Specifically,
MOEA/D-DE, MOEA/D-DEM, MOEA/D-GA, MOEA/D-Levy and
NSGA-II, will be proposed as numerical methods to optimise a portfolio consisting of all 40 stocks of the FTSE MIB index. The optimisation achieved an outperforming portfolio against its benchmark (+15%)
